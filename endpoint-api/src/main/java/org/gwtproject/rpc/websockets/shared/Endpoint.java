/**
 * Marks an interface as part of a pair to have serializers generated, and
 * easy wiring supplied to let this abstract out communication with its matching
 * endpoint.
 *
 * This and another matching interface should reference each other in the annotation
 * or in the generics of Client, Server (or future Worker, Page) interfaces. These
 * will may have no intrisic meaning, but make for an easier way to find a
 * matching implementation, or set up other generics in other tools.
 *
 * An endpoint object instance isn't usable by itself, but needs its counterpart
 * instance to function. For example, on the server, a Server instance would be
 * implemented and a Client type generated. A matched pair of instances would be
 * created and each assigned to the other when a new connect is created from a browser.
 *
 * On the client, the Server type is generated, while the Client is implemented.
 * To connect, the client code would ask for a Server connection to be made, and then
 * assign its own Client instance.
